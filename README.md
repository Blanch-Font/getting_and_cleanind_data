# Project Course

This Github contians three files:
+ README.md explains the whole project
+ CodeBook.md describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
+ run_analysis.R is the sintaxy to generate the tidy database.
 
The R script needs the dplyr library.
